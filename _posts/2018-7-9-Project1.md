# Project 1 - Using MTA data to identify likely terror targets
#### by Anders Olson-Swanson

## Setup

During the first week at Metis, we were tasked with creating a project using the MTA turnstile data.

For our project, we worked in groups to create a hypothetical client and create a presentation about why they should hire us. My group decided to use the NYPD as our client. The setup was that the NYPD had received a tip about a potential subway terror attack at 42nd St. The question was to determine which station and what time was most likely. By narrowing down the likely attack point, the police would be able to better deploy their limited resources in order to thwart the attack.

The MTA dataset consists of cumulative entries and exits for every turnstile in NYC for approximately every 4 hours. Initially, we tried using six months of data but that quickly proved unwieldy. We decided on three months as the overall time patterns were still present and our code was able to run much faster. Additionally, we believe that it gave a better representation of current trends.

## Initial Steps

Our first step was to clean the data, getting rid of any outliers that were clearly due to faulty machines. Once we cleaned the data, the next step was to determine which of the four stations on 42nd St (shown below) was the most likely target.

* Grand Central - 42nd St
* Bryant Park - 42nd St
* Times Square - 42nd St
* Port Authority - 42nd St

The metric we used for this was total volume through each station as we believe a terror attack would target highly populated stations. We calculated the total number of entries and exits for each stations which showed that Grand Central was the most trafficked station by about 7.5 million riders during the 3-month period.

We then decided to drill down on Grand Central to figure out which days of the week had more riders. Unsurprisingly, the weekdays had significantly more riders than the weekend. The number of riders were pretty consistent Monday through Friday. This makes sense given that Grand Central is a commuter hub and people generally have the same schedules during the week. The graph below shows our results.

## Narrowing in on a Specific Time

Once we realized that the weekends weren't high traffic days, we were able to focus strictly on the weekdays. We decided to keep each weekday since there wasn't a significant difference between each day. Our next step was figure out which time periods during the day were most likely.

Since the MTA captured entries/exits every 4 hours or so, each time stamp represented more than just the exact hour. In order to get around this, we created buckets throughout the day and put each timestamp in a certain bucket. After we graphed this, we noticed that the highest periods were 8am - 12pm and 4pm - 8pm. This makes sense as those periods contain morning and evening rush hour.

## Focusing on Specific Areas of Grand Central

Now we have a specific station, certain days of the week, and certain time slots, definitely an improvement from where we started. But with a giant station like Grand Central, it might be helpful if there were a way to narrow down where extra police presence would be warranted. Our approach was to use the control area information to get a better sense of which parts of the station were more crowded, if any. We created a heatmap showing the total ridership by time slot and control area.

The result clearly shows that R238 has a much greater total ridership than any of the control areas in the station. Using this information can help inform where the NYPD should place their resources more heavily in order to have the best chance of prevention.
